Hey there! I am Harsh Tiku,a computer science undergraduate from National Institute of Technology Hamirpur.I love experimenting with technology,writing code and listening to psychedelic music.I am currently working on AI projects as I believe that a breakthrough in machine learning is what will bring a plethora of unimaginable changes to the world in the future. I like problem solving and building a mathematical approach to tackle the real world problems. 

<h1>The Personal Me</h1>
I am a empath, who will happily choose a bonfire with 3 Friends over a club-night with 30.I like people with whom I can be comfortably silent with ,sit on the terrace while sipping coffee talking about life,psychology and science.You know the vibe :P
