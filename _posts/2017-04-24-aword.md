I might be a few things, a great talker ain't one of them.During my journey of being lost in the realm of my own thoughts ,
I realized that I am missing out on a plethora of chances to learn and grow through communicating and connecting with the 
extraordinary minds that exist on this planet.So to overcome this limitation,I thought of conveying my chaos via the most 
beloved media of the world; the Internet.A few options came to my mind, Wordpress? Tumblr? They provided innumerable themes 
and perks and really encouraged me to write while they took care of the webpage.Yet I chose Github Pages to host my blog for 
it compelled me to learn how to experiment with my own webpage and manage the SEO and the analytics, and the little inventor 
in me would not back down from experimenting on the vast universe of my own imagination,an ability other platforms werent 
very flexible with,despite their illusion of choice.I saw the webpage grow,a piece at a time rather than being spoonfed 
from the buffet of so called classy themes and interfaces.In my articles, I will talk about the stuff the matters to the
Computing Community and my journey of exploring the intricacies of this incredible science,element by element. 
I may talk about life and psychology once in a while because hey! You don't want to come off as a nerd, do you? :P
