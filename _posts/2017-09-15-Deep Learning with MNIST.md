title: Deep Learning  on MNIST Datasets

---

Deep Learning is the sublte extraction of machine learning into domains of feature extraction via a more deep stack of neural network.Machine Learning is science of learning the essence of data given extracted features but the method seems to be less computationally feasible as the number of features increase dramatically,like in images.eg, a 28*28 image would have a total of 784 features,i.e. the 784 pixel values.So we try to train models that learn the importamt features of the datasets themselves,rather than hogging on the entire feature space.
