title: About time when I found Thor's Hammer!
---

I started off as a naive programmer,as I begun my first year at NIT Hamirpur,well yeah everyone does.I had no background of Computer Science from high
school,even though I knew I could pull off some pretty cool stuff with it.During my engineering courses, I came across C and C++
which i tried to master thoroughly.I implemented my data structures with complete sincerity and would be pretty happy to build
algorithms and see them compute solutions over my pretty datasets.Even though when I looked around I saw people creating stuff,with
implementation details beyond the scope of my vision or knowledge,with databases,front-ends and back-ends,User-Interfaces and I just stood like thinking
Emmm! Bro I'm intimidated! I also wanted to create all the cool stuff but did'nt know where to start learning, learn the web or the user-interface libraries
of java or .NET etc.

I had heard about the flexibility and scalabilty of **python** earlier but always hesitated to learn a new programming language
because hey! every programming language has this new set of syntax definitions which takes a tiring amount of time to master.
But one night I was scrolling through my learning resources and randomly opened my Python book,and came across the first program **helloworld.py**
It was just one line `print('hello world')`.
