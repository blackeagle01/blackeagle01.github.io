title: About time when I found Thor's Hammer!
---

I started off as a naive programmer,as I begun my first year at NIT Hamirpur,well yeah everyone does.I had no background of Computer Science from high
school,even though I knew I could pull off some pretty cool stuff with it.During my engineering courses, I came across C and C++
which i tried to master thoroughly.I implemented my data structures with complete sincerity and would be pretty happy to build
algorithms and see them compute solutions over my pretty datasets.Even though when I looked around I saw people creating stuff,with
implementation details beyond the scope of my vision or knowledge,with databases,front-ends and back-ends,User-Interfaces and I just stood like thinking
Emmm! Bro I'm intimidated! I also wanted to create all the cool stuff but did'nt know where to start learning, learn the web or the user-interface libraries
of java or .NET etc.

I had heard about the flexibility and scalabilty of **python** earlier but always hesitated to learn a new programming language
because hey! every programming language has this new set of syntax definitions which takes a tiring amount of time to master.
But one night I was scrolling through my learning resources and randomly opened my Python book,and came across the first program **helloworld.py**.
It was just one line :

```

print('hello world')

```

I thought to myself, yeah! thats pretty neat!.

I continued reading the text and discovered python had everything I wished for everytime I wrote code in C++(no offense though :P). It had incredible data structures dynamic lists with method implementations,i.e. arrays with insertion and deletion capabilties and method calls so useful,dictionaries which helped me map anything to almost anything with minimal syntax. I could return arrays from functions, I had sets and tuples.I practiced object oriented programming in C++ earlier but never really realized its usability until I started working with python. Elementary operations like sorting which although coding efficiently do take some effort, were already implemented with the best algorithms in python and were as Charlie Puth says:  Just One call Away.eg

```
In1: l=[3,1,2,4,5]

In2: l.sort()

In3: print(l)

Out3:[1,2,3,4,5]
```
I could check whether an element existed in a list with just:

```
In1: 3 in l
Out1: True
In2: 9 in l
Out2: False
```
I felt like I was cutting trees with swiss knives until now, and had grown pretty comfortable with it,but by the time I discovered this mighty sword, I felt invincible.I could test code snippets on the go in the python interpreter without having to type and compile a new test program everytime I wanted to check something.I found python had a ever growing community of open source contributors,which created and maintained extremely useful modules(libraries) that i could spawn with a click of a button and utilize their functionality with incredible ease.I was playing legos with software development,and I need to worry about manufacturing plastic anymore.
